Music of the Night Sky
=========

Creative Coding Final

The Concept: As we gaze into the night sky we often find ourselves connecting the points of light. We take these connections and usually turn them into pictorial representations of mythic animals or people. But what if there was another way which we could experience the patterns of stars. With this project we will transform a nights sky into a musical instrument allowing us to create the songs of the cosmos.      

The Details: A nights sky passes across the viewport. Within the sky are stars which call out with little rings around themselves. These stars can be connected to each other allowing for a melody to be created. The more stars that are connected the longer the melody becomes. The stars are constantly moving across the screen and once a star passes off the screen the note stops playing.
